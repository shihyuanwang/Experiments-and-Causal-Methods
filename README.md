# Experiments and Causal Methods using R


1. Clinic Sales - Experiment Analysis

Einfach Medical Supplies (EMS) sells a disposable testing device to clinics and is trying to expand their business in a new region. They want to find a better way to pitch the product when visiting a clinic. A Clinic Sales Experiment was designed to test whether different opening pitches have different effects on conversion of clinics by using a randomized controlled design.

3. Field Experiments - Clustered Randomization

In this case there were 200 stores in a company, which were divided randomly into 100 treatment and 100 control stores. At the treatment stores they put up pictures of people using the items the store sells and are testing to see whether these “in-store advertisements” affect how much people buy. They collected data on the first 1,000 people to come into the stores after the launch of the test and recorded for each of those 1,000 people the amount they purchased at the store.

4. Rating Case - Difference in Difference

A company operating retail stores launched a store redesign at a set of 50 retail locations in one region of the country.  They are interested to know whether this redesign caused an increase in sales.  They did not randomly select stores for the redesign.  However, they identified a set of 50 comparison stores from another region of the country that they believe should provide a useful "control" for the "treatment" stores.  There were no changes at these 50 comparison stores.  

The data set they have available for analysis has 24 months of data, with months 1 through 12 being the year before the change took effect and months 13 through 24 corresponding to the year when the redesign was in place at the stores in the treatment region.  For each of those months they have data on the total sales (in dollars) at each store, for both the 50 stores in the treatment region and the 50 stores in the control region.
